# Agent Handoff — Pratha

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last updated | 2026-09-26 |
| Branch | `devin/1790111517-pratha-supabase-platform` (PR #1, open) |
| Current phase | Hosted Supabase integration complete for catalog/Auth/booking/contribution; `rishi-ask` Edge Function live; external-credential work remains |
| Overall status | **Not production-ready.** Web, Android and Expo builds pass; hosted RLS/RPC flows verified end-to-end; AI works via deployed Edge Function with Cloudflare Worker fallback. Payments, notification provider, custom SMTP and Auth dashboard settings are blocked on credentials/approvals |

## Product and architecture

Pratha (formerly Sattva) is a cultural, temple, Pooja, Gaushala, Seva, and spiritual-assistance platform. The web app is React 19 + Vite + React Router + TanStack Query + Tailwind + Radix + Lucide. Android wraps `web/dist` with Capacitor. iOS uses the existing Expo SDK 57 DOM bridge in `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx`; do not rewrite the web UI into React Native primitives.

```text
React DOM web / Capacitor Android / Expo DOM iOS
                         ↓
Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL/RLS + RPCs (+ Edge Functions: not deployed)
                         ↓
Razorpay, Gemini, notifications (not configured)
```

The Cloudflare Worker and Firebase client remain only as fallback paths (Rishi AI still calls the Worker, request `{query}` → response `{response}`, with a local fallback answer). All catalog, profile, family, Auth, booking and contribution code uses `web/src/lib/supabase.ts` and `web/src/lib/api/*.ts`.

Expo bridge note: `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx` imports `QueryClientProvider`/`queryClient` re-exported from `web/src/App.tsx` so Metro uses one TanStack Query copy (two copies split the provider context). `expo/env.d.ts` types `import.meta.env` for the shared Supabase client.

## Hosted Supabase state

- Project `Pratha`, ref `yxwwgynxgihrktwndhep`, region `ap-south-1`, URL `https://yxwwgynxgihrktwndhep.supabase.co`
- Supabase MCP (`supabase-mcp-server`) has write access: `apply_migration`, `execute_sql`, `get_logs`, `get_advisors` were used. No local Supabase CLI.
- Browser key: publishable key fallback in `web/src/lib/supabase.ts`; deployments should set `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. `web/.env` does not exist locally.

Applied migrations (all hosted):

1. `001_sattva_schema` … 6. `006_demonstration_catalog`
7. `20260925000100_007_security_hardening.sql`
8. `20260926000100_008_restore_policy_helper_grants.sql` — 007 revoked EXECUTE on the six RLS helper functions from `anon`/`authenticated`, which broke every public SELECT (`42501 permission denied for function manages_temple`). Policy expressions run as the caller, so these helpers must stay executable. 008 restores that (matching 005).
9. `20260926000200_009_live_darshan_seed.sql` — `live_streams` demo rows using `website` provider to official portals (no stable official 24/7 stream exists; YouTube embeds supported by the UI).
10. `20260926000300_010_booking_status_enum_cast.sql` — `create_puja_booking` cast of CASE result to `booking_status`.
11. `20260926000400_011_booking_rpc_searchpath.sql` — restores `search_path = public, extensions` and generates refs from `gen_random_uuid()` (010 had dropped pgcrypto from the path → `gen_random_bytes does not exist`).
12. `20260926000500_012_indexes_and_extension_schema.sql` — 39 covering indexes on unindexed FKs + `pg_trgm` moved to `extensions` schema (advisor findings).
13. `20260926000600_013_edge_secret_accessor.sql` — `supabase_vault` extension + `public.get_edge_secret(text)` SECURITY DEFINER accessor granted to `service_role` only. The `gemini_api_key` vault secret was created via MCP (values never live in migration files).
14. `20261001000100_014_profile_birth_details.sql` — dob/tob/pob/lat/lon columns + UPDATE grants.
15. `20261002000100_015_demo_catalog_seed.sql` — 7 temples, 15 puja offerings, 4 festivals, 7 events, 4 live portals, 6 animals, 4 seva campaigns.
16. `20261003000100_016_referrals.sql` — `profiles.referral_code`, `public.referrals` ledger, `ensure_referral_code`/`record_referral` RPCs (authenticated-only). Applied via MCP `execute_sql`.
17. `20261003000200_017_notifications.sql` — `pg_net`, `notification_log`, `referrals_notify_credit` trigger → `notify-send` edge fn. Vault: `resend_api_key`, `notify_hook_secret`, `notify_function_url`, `supabase_publishable_key`.

Security model (verified via MCP): RLS enabled on all public tables; six policy helpers executable by anon/authenticated (intended); booking/contribution RPCs authenticated-only; payment/notification functions service-role-only; `profiles` has own-row SELECT/UPDATE only (rows created by `handle_new_user` trigger, so the client uses UPDATE, never UPSERT); bookings/contributions writable only through RPCs.

Advisor findings (2026-09-26, security): `anon/authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` for the six policy helpers — intentional, documented above; they only inspect `auth.uid()` roles. `complete_booking`, `generate_vaccine_alerts`, `recompute_trust_score` were audited and already contain internal role checks (`manages_temple`, `manages_gaushala`, `is_gaushala_admin`). `pg_trgm` moved out of `public` (012); all unindexed FKs covered (012). Remaining: leaked-password protection disabled (dashboard toggle, needs user).

Edge Function `rishi-ask` (deployed, `verify_jwt` + in-function `auth.getUser()` check; anon key alone rejected): Gemini key resolves from `GEMINI_API_KEY` function secret, else the `gemini_api_key` vault secret via `get_edge_secret`. `AI_MODEL` env overrides `gemini-2.5-flash`. Source: `supabase/functions/rishi-ask/index.ts`; client: `web/src/lib/api/ai.ts` falls back to the Worker on function failure.

The Cloudflare Worker `utsavam-backend` is deployed under a different Cloudflare account (`utsavam-api` workers.dev subdomain) than the one this environment's Cloudflare MCP can see — redeploying it to add JWT verification to `/api/v1/ai/ask` needs wrangler login for that account. Its unauthenticated AI route remains as fallback; treat as quota-exposure debt.

## Current implementation status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public Home | Working | Hosted Pooja + `welfare_stats` (`animals_cared`, `gaushalas`, `temples`); no fabricated meal stat |
| Discover + detail routes | Working | `/discover`, `/temples/:slug`, `/events/:slug`, `/festivals/:slug`, `/darshan`, `/darshan/:id` via `web/src/lib/api/discover.ts`. Event selects must use `categories!events_category_id_fkey(name)` (events has two FKs to categories → PostgREST 300 otherwise) |
| Pooja booking | Working | Date picker honors `lead_time_days`/`available_days`; sankalpa/nakshatra validation; real RPC errors shown; free → confirmed, paid → pending_payment; no fabricated references |
| Gaushala / passports | Working | Animals + `breeds(name)` + Gaushala embeds; chips filter client-side |
| Seva contributions | Working (unpaid) | Real published campaigns; `create_contribution` RPC; rows stay `created` until a payment flow exists |
| Profile/family | Working | Profile UPDATE and family insert verified via hosted E2E |
| Supabase Auth | Working | Email/password verified; forgot-password + recovery in `Auth.tsx`; Resend SMTP configured by user in dashboard; Google OAuth wired (button + `pratha://auth/callback` deep link) — needs redirect allow-list entry and a real-device test |
| Firebase/Worker retirement | Partial | Rishi primary = `rishi-ask` Edge Function (verified 200 with user JWT); Worker kept as unauthenticated fallback |
| Payments | Blocked | Needs Razorpay sandbox keys + webhook Edge Function + sandbox validation |
| AI Edge Function | Working | `rishi-ask` deployed and verified; Gemini key in vault; signed-in-only |
| Notification Edge Function | Blocked | Needs notification provider credentials |
| Expo | Passing | `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` succeeds |
| Android | Passing | `npx cap sync android` + `./gradlew assembleDebug` pass (set `ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk`) |

PostgREST reminder: to-one embeds return objects, not arrays (`row.temples?.name`, never `row.temples?.[0]`).

## Important files

- `web/src/App.tsx` — routes, QueryClient, AuthProvider; re-exports query provider for Expo.
- `web/src/features/auth/Auth.tsx` / `AuthContext.tsx` — Supabase Auth, forgot password, recovery.
- `web/src/features/discover/*` — Discover, TempleDetail, EventDetail, FestivalDetail, LiveDarshan.
- `web/src/features/pujas/PujaDetailModal.tsx` — booking UX (keep all hooks above the early return).
- `web/src/features/seva/DonationModal.tsx`, `web/src/features/gaushala/SponsorModal.tsx` — contributions.
- `web/src/lib/api/{puja,gaushala,profile,discover,errors,ai,client}.ts` — data layer; `errors.ts` maps RPC error codes to user messages.
- `web/scripts/e2e-hosted.mjs` — hosted Supabase E2E (auth, RLS, RPCs).
- `supabase/migrations/` — schema history through 011.
- `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx`, `expo/env.d.ts` — preserve.
- `web/android/` — generated Capacitor output; do not edit manually.

## Validation performed (2026-09-26)

- `web`: `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint` (0 errors, 9 warnings), `npm run build` pass.
- `expo`: `tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx expo export --platform web` succeeds.
- Android: debug APK `web/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` builds.
- Hosted E2E (`node web/scripts/e2e-hosted.mjs`): 19/19 passed — confirmed sign-in, anon reads, anon RPC rejection, profile update, cross-user insert rejection, family insert, booking validation errors, free/paid bookings, owner RLS reads, direct-insert rejection, contribution, cancellation.
- Browser QA (Python Playwright + system Chromium; the Playwright MCP needs `/opt/google/chrome/chrome`, which is not installed): 20 desktop (1440×900) + mobile (390×844) route checks with no console errors and no HTTP 300/4xx/5xx. Signed-in UI booking `PRT-192CBE75` and ₹10 contribution `4e025aae-…` verified in hosted rows via MCP (booking `confirmed` for 2026-09-27; contribution `created`, 1000 paise, campaign `50000000-…-0001`). Signed-out booking/donation redirect to `/login`.
- QA round 1 bugs fixed: booking modal Rules-of-Hooks crash, event 300 ambiguous embed, Gaushala `gaushala_id=eq.All` 400, wrong `welfare_stats` fields, array-shaped embeds.
- Migrations 012/013 applied via MCP: 39 FK indexes created (140 public indexes total), `pg_trgm` in `extensions`, `get_edge_secret` granted to service_role only (anon rejected with 42501).
- `rishi-ask` Edge Function v3 live: no auth header → 401, publishable-key-only → 401, signed-in user → 200 with a real Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` response.
- **Android emulator E2E (Pixel_9 AVD)**: debug APK installs, launches, safe-area insets correct (see below), `/profile` redirects signed-out users to `/login`, email/password sign-in against hosted Supabase succeeds and the session persists across app reinstalls. Demo account `pratha.demo.client@gmail.com` (server-confirmed email) is the client-testing credential.
- Emulator caveat: the WebView renderer occasionally crashes on cold boot under the software GPU (`swiftshader`), freezing the app on "Restoring Sacred Session". Force-stop + relaunch recovers. Verify on hardware before assuming an app bug.

## Janma recommendations (migration 014, fn `kundali-ask`)

- `profiles` gained `birth_date/birth_time/birth_place/birth_lat/birth_lon`. NOTE: `profiles` uses **column-scoped UPDATE grants** — new columns need `GRANT UPDATE (...) TO authenticated` or client saves fail with 42501.
- `kundali-ask` edge fn (JWT-gated): Schlyter low-precision ephemeris → sidereal via Lahiri ayanamsa → nakshatra/pada, moon+sun rashi, tithi, lagna. Lagna = ecliptic horizon-scan (alt zero-crossing with sin(hourAngle)<0 — closed-form atan2 versions return the descendant ~180° off). POB resolves via offline CITY_COORDS table first, Nominatim fallback; tz auto-derived (IST inside India bbox). Gemini narration needs `thinkingConfig:{thinkingBudget:0}` — gemini-2.5 burns output tokens on thinking and truncates otherwise.
- UI: Profile → Settings → "Janma Details" form; `/pujas` shows "For Your Janma" card (or a CTA to add birth details).
- `BirthDetailsPrompt` (mounted under ProtectedRoute in App.tsx): post-login modal capturing name + DOB/TOB/POB when profile lacks birth details; "Maybe later" snoozes 7 days via `pratha-janma-dismissed` timestamp in localStorage (legacy `'1'` flag counts as expired → prior dismissers get re-prompted once).
- `ProfileNudge` on Home: completeness bar (8 fields: name/photo/phone/city/gotra/birth date/time/place) linking to /profile; hides when full.
- Edit Profile (Profile → Settings): avatar upload to `avatars` bucket at `{uid}/avatar-<ts>.<ext>` (storage policies already scope writes to own folder; bucket is public-read → render via `avatarPublicUrl(avatarPath)`), plus display_name/phone/city/gotra. Avatar shows in mobile header dot, sidebar account card, profile header; displayName drives Home greeting + AppShell name.
- Native Google sign-in (Android): `web/src/lib/auth/oauth.ts` uses `@capgo/capacitor-social-login` — native Credential Manager bottom-sheet → `idToken` → `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken`. Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` (the OAuth **Web** client ID from Supabase → Auth → Providers → Google) at build time, **and** an Android-type OAuth client in the same GCP project (package `com.utsavam.sattva`, debug SHA-1 `7D:1B:5D:36:B0:4C:B5:E6:10:10:C2:7E:43:EC:8C:27:05:98:66:22`; add the release-keystore SHA-1 for signed builds). Falls back to the browser OAuth + `pratha://auth/callback` deep-link flow when unconfigured or the user cancels. **Gotcha:** never pass `options.scopes` to `SocialLogin.login` — it requires a `ModifiedMainActivityForSocialLoginPlugin` class in MainActivity and rejects at runtime (silent browser fallback). ID token alone is sufficient. Verified on emulator: native Credential Manager 'Sign in with ease' sheet renders in-app. Google OAuth inside a WebView is blocked by Google — this plugin is the correct in-app path.
- Migration 015 seeds the demo catalog (deterministic 2*/3*/4*/5*/6*/7*/8*/9* uuids, `on conflict do nothing`): 4 temples + deity_i18n tags, 13 puja_offerings across all offering_kinds, 3 festivals, 4 events, 2 live_streams, 4 animals, 2 seva_campaigns, 2 welfare_updates. Generated columns: `name`/`title` derive from `*_i18n` — never insert them literally.
- Pujas filter chips: 'For You' (keyword-matches offerings vs nakshatra lord/deity map in PujaDiscovery), 'Nakshatra Pujas' (requires_nakshatra), 'Popular', per-kind ('Special'/'Archana'/'Abhishekam'/'Gau Seva'). `Puja.offeringKind` now mapped.
- QA note: `innerText` returns CSS-transformed text — check labels case-insensitively (`/for your janma/i`).
- Dark-theme glass: `--color-glass`/`--color-glass-border` tokens + `.glass-card` utility (translucent elevated surface + backdrop-blur); applied to shared `Card` + `.discover-card` + nudge. All `prefers-color-scheme: dark` CSS was converted to `html[data-theme='dark']` — the manual theme toggle ignores OS otherwise.
- Accuracy caveat: low-precision (~arc-minutes). For production-grade kundali, swap in a real astrology API (Vedic Rishi / Prokerala) — the chart shape is designed to be replaced server-side.

## Access model (updated 2026-10-01)

- Browsing is **public** again (client request — no login on entry). `/profile` alone is auth-gated; transactional RPCs remain server-side RLS-enforced.
- Login screen has **"Explore Demo Account"** — one-tap sign-in as `pratha.demo.client@gmail.com` (RLS-scoped; rotate after client testing). Hardcoded creds in `Auth.tsx` by design.
- Session identity: desktop sidebar card (name + "Signed in · email"), mobile header avatar + status dot; signed-out shows "Sign In" affordances.
- `vercel.json` ships CSP (script-src 'self' + sha256 of the `index.html` theme inline script — **regenerate the hash if that script changes**), frame-src limited to youtube.com embeds, nosniff, DENY framing, Permissions-Policy.

## Deployment (Vercel)

- **Live: `https://pratha-two.vercel.app`** — project `pratha` (team `marvelpokemaster-3377s-projects`), git-connected to `marvelpokemaster/Pratha`; pushes to `main` auto-deploy. Prod env vars set: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- `web/vercel.json` — Vite SPA config: `dist` output, catch-all rewrite to `index.html`, immutable asset caching. `.vercel/` is gitignored.
- PENDING (user): add `https://pratha-two.vercel.app/**` to Supabase Auth redirect URLs and set it as Site URL (or alongside the app scheme), or Google OAuth/reset links won't round-trip on the web.

## Known layout trap (fixed 2026-10-01)

- `index.css` had `* { margin: 0; padding: 0 }` as **unlayered** CSS, which beats all `@layer utilities` rules — silently killed every Tailwind margin utility (incl. `md:ml-64`, `mx-auto` centering). Removed; Tailwind preflight already resets. If spacing ever looks wrong on desktop, suspect cascade-layer issues first.
- Minimum text size is now 11px (`text-[10px]`→`text-[11px]` on nav labels, badges, chips).
- Main content is full-bleed (`p-4 md:p-8 xl:px-12 2xl:px-16`, no max-width cap) — sidebar `md:ml-64` relies on `main` having NO `w-full` (auto width fills minus margin). Fluid root font: `html { font-size: clamp(16px, 0.35vw+13.3px, 19px) }` scales all rem utilities with viewport.

## Android edge-to-edge & theme

- `@capawesome/capacitor-android-edge-to-edge-support` is required on Android 15+: Android WebView never populates `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; the plugin injects real insets so the existing `env()` CSS works. Without it the header renders under the status bar.
- Theme is `data-theme`-driven (`web/src/lib/theme.ts`), not `prefers-color-scheme` media queries: `localStorage["pratha-theme"]` = `light|dark|system`; `index.html` sets `data-theme` before first paint; dark tokens live under `:root[data-theme='dark']`; `@custom-variant dark` makes Tailwind `dark:` utilities follow the attribute. Settings tab → Appearance segmented control. `@capacitor/status-bar` syncs status-bar icon contrast.
- `/profile` is wrapped in `RequireAuth` (redirects to `/login` signed-out) — other routes stay public by design; booking/contribution modals gate per-action.
- `.action-tile` is shared by `<Link>` and `<button>` (Rishi tile); it needs `text-align: left`/`font: inherit` normalization or the button centers its text.

## Dharma Mitra Referral Program (added 2026-10-02)

- Frontend referral system (`web/src/lib/referral.ts`) generating deterministic devotee codes (`PRATHA-<NAME>-<HASH>`) and shareable links (`/?ref=<CODE>`).
- URL inbound capture: `captureInboundReferral()` runs in `App.tsx` on initial mount, storing the code in `localStorage['pratha_inbound_ref_code']`.
- Sign-up integration: `Auth.tsx` pre-fills the referral code field during registration and forwards it to `supabase.auth.signUp({ options: { data: { referred_by: code } } })`.
- Profile integration: `/profile` gained an **"Invite & Earn"** tab featuring one-click WhatsApp sharing with auspicious invite message, Web Share API (`navigator.share`), clipboard copy buttons with visual feedback, and 108 Punya points merit counter.
- Home screen prompt: A "Dharma Mitra Referral" banner on `/` directs devotees to `/profile?tab=referral`.
- Settings form layout fix (2026-10-02): Resolved overlapping inline `<label>` elements in `Profile.tsx` (Edit Profile & Janma Details) by migrating to responsive Tailwind CSS grid layouts (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` and `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`) with dedicated `.form-group`, `.form-label`, and `.form-input` definitions in `Profile.css`.

## Server-side referral attribution + engagement emails (added 2026-10-03)

- **Migration 016 (`referrals`)**: `profiles.referral_code` (unique, backfilled `PRATHA-<NAME>-<ID4>`), `public.referrals` ledger (`unique(referred_user_id)` prevents double-credit, self-referral CHECK), RPCs `ensure_referral_code()` + `record_referral(text)` (SECURITY DEFINER, `authenticated`-only, anon revoked). Before this, `referred_by` only sat in `user_metadata` and the punya counter read a never-written localStorage key — rewards never accrued.
- **Migration 017 (`notifications`)**: `public.notification_log` (dedupe, `unique(user_id,type)`), `pg_net` extension, `referrals_notify_credit` AFTER-INSERT trigger → `net.http_post` to the `notify-send` edge fn. Trigger fn is revoked from all client roles. Vault secrets: `resend_api_key`, `notify_hook_secret`, `notify_function_url`, `supabase_publishable_key`.
- **`notify-send` edge function** (`supabase/functions/notify-send/`, `verify_jwt: false` — pg_net can't mint JWTs; every path guarded in-code): two caller modes — user JWT (self-only `welcome`, `janma_ready`) or `x-notify-secret` header (`referral_credited`). Sends via Resend API; HTML templates are terracotta-themed. Verified end-to-end via a real referral insert → 200 → email delivered.
- **Client wiring**: `referral.ts` gained `ensureReferralCode`, `recordStoredReferral`, `getReferralStatsServer`, `sendEngagementEmail`. `AuthContext` runs a once-per-session onboarding effect (ensure code → credit stored referral → welcome email). `Profile` uses the canonical DB code + server stats. `PujaDiscovery` fires `janma_ready` when the chart loads and links the janma card to the referral tab (trigger-moment share CTA).
- **Resend limit**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (test domain) only delivers to the Resend account owner's inbox. To email all users, verify a domain at resend.com/domains and update `FROM` in `notify-send/index.ts`.
- **FCM push (2026-10-03)**: Firebase project `sattva-utsavam-dev` (same GCP project as Google OAuth); Android app `1:1080658765469:android:8d5960177b71f50fdbd674` registered for `com.utsavam.sattva`; `google-services.json` in `web/android/app/` (gradle plugin already wired by Capacitor defaults). `@capacitor/push-notifications` installed; `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` in the manifest; `push_tokens` table (migration 018) stores device tokens via `registerPushToken()` in AuthContext. `notify-send` v4 sends FCM v1 pushes using the `fcm_service_account` vault secret — **secret not yet populated**: needs a service-account JSON (Firebase console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate private key). Until then pushes silently skip; emails still send.

## Admin portal (added 2026-10-03)

- `/admin` ("Sanctum Control") — `web/src/features/admin/Admin.tsx` + `web/src/lib/api/admin.ts`. Gated client-side by `getMyAdminRoles()` (user_roles own-row SELECT) and server-side by existing RLS (`is_admin()`, `manages_temple()` already scope every admin-relevant table).
- The **Admin nav item only renders when `user_roles` is non-empty** for the signed-in user (`AppShell` query `['admin-roles']`, same key used by the page).
- Tabs: **Overview** (RLS-scoped counts), **Bookings** (list + `complete_booking`/`cancel_puja_booking` RPCs), **Devotees** (profiles), **Roles** (super_admin only — grant/revoke via direct `user_roles` writes allowed by `user_roles_admin` policy).
- Role enum: `super_admin`, `editor`, `temple_admin`, `gaushala_admin`, `gaushala_staff`, `vet`; scopes `global`/`temple`/`gaushala`. `marvelpokemaster@gmail.com` has `super_admin` global; the demo account has `editor` (kept for demoing the portal — revoke via Roles tab or SQL).
- Verified: non-admin sees no Admin item and `/admin` redirects `/`; editor sees portal minus Roles tab.

## Content CMS — Sanctum Control → Content (added 2026-10-03)

- WordPress-style CMS at `/admin` → Content. `web/src/features/cms/` + `web/src/lib/api/cms.ts`. Registry-driven: `entities.ts` declares each entity's fields/relations/defaults; `CmsPanel.tsx` renders section rail + list + editor drawer; `fields.tsx` is the input library (text/money/enum/date/datetime/relation/image/days-chips/json/uuid).
- 9 entities: Pujas, Cows, Temples, Events, Festivals, Darshan Streams, Seva Campaigns, Welfare Updates, Editorial. Draft → Publish workflow (status enum); Archive is a soft delete.
- List select columns are per-entity: `live_streams` has no `slug`; `welfare_updates` has no `created_at`/`updated_at` (orderCol → `published_at`). Column existence per table: SLUG_TABLES + `EntityConfig.orderCol`. (only SLUG_TABLES get `slug` — `animals`/`welfare_updates`/`editorial_blocks` lack the column; querying it breaks the whole list).
- **Edit loads the FULL row** (`getRow`) — the list row only has a few columns; saving a partial row would null un-fetched fields and overwrite `*_i18n` locales. i18n-backed fields (description/story/summary/body) have NO plain column — select/write only the `*_i18n` key. Archive button is draft-status entities only (animal_status enum has no 'archived').
- **Broadcast push**: publishing an event/festival/live-stream/offering fires `notify_content_published()` (trigger, migration 021) → `notify-send` `type:'broadcast'` → FCM per-token to all registered devices + `notifications` inbox row for every user. Weekly digest cron `engagement-weekly` Sundays 08:30 IST.
- **Android push layer** (`web/src/lib/push.ts`): creates `pratha_notifications` channel (importance HIGH → heads-up/lock-screen), requests POST_NOTIFICATIONS at login, foreground mirrors FCM via LocalNotifications (FCM is silent in foreground), tap deep-links via `data.route`. `notify-send` FCM payload sets `android.notification.channel_id=pratha_notifications` + optional `image` (big-picture). Topics NOT used — Capacitor 8 plugin doesn't expose them; broadcast fans out over `push_tokens`.
- **push_tokens gotchas**: table cols are `id,user_id,platform,token,last_seen` — no `created_at`/`updated_at`; `token` has a UNIQUE constraint (022) required for the client's `upsert onConflict:'token'`. Capacitor listeners MUST attach before `register()` — FCM delivers cached tokens synchronously.
- **Admin query gotcha: never embed `profiles` via `x:profiles(...)` — `puja_bookings.user_id` (and `notification_outbox.user_id`) reference `auth.users`, not `profiles`, so PostgREST can't resolve the join and 400s the whole query. Fetch profiles separately with `.in('id', userIds)` and join client-side. Also: `puja_offerings` uses `name_i18n`, not `title_i18n`.
- **Demo accounts** (login-page one-tap buttons — REMOVE pre-production): **Explore Admin Console** → `pratha.demo.client@gmail.com` (`editor` role) → lands on `/admin`. **Explore Demo Account** → `pratha.demo.devotee@gmail.com` (plain user) → lands on `/`. Admin demo sets `sessionStorage.postLoginRedirect='/admin'` which Auth.tsx's post-sign-in effect honors (without it the effect's `navigate('/')` races and wins). Also fixed `/admin` roles-gate race: query disabled while user resolves → now waits for `roles !== undefined` before bouncing non-admins.
- **Gotcha**: `name`/`title` columns are GENERATED from `*_i18n` — writes must go to `name_i18n`/`title_i18n` only (buildPayload `continue`s past generated keys when `i18n` is set).
- Per-entity `defaults` fill NOT-NULL non-form columns (currency INR, activities_i18n {}, sponsorship_raised, published_at). `__now__` resolves to current timestamp.
- Images upload to `public-media/cms/{entity}/…` (admin write policy exists). Relation pickers are RLS-scoped (scoped admins only see their own entities).
- Overview tab now shows business metrics (seva ₹ collected, pending/confirmed bookings, Punya issued). Migration 020 adds `audit_log` admin SELECT.

## AI engagement orchestration (added 2026-10-03)

- **`engagement-orchestrator` edge fn** (`supabase/functions/engagement-orchestrator/`, deployed v4, `verify_jwt:false`). Auth: super_admin JWT or `x-notify-secret`. Modes:
  - `plan` — gathers per-user signals (missing `birth_date`, no bookings, referral count, idle days; skips users contacted today) → one `gemini-2.5-flash` call picks each devotee's best next action + drafts title/body/CTA → `notification_outbox` rows (channel `email`, status `pending`). Actions are **index-mapped** to the candidate list — Gemini must not echo userIds (it mutates UUIDs).
  - `send` — drains pending rows: in-app `notifications` row (always) + Resend email + FCM push to `push_tokens`. Retries cap at 3 attempts.
- **Admin → Engagement tab**: Plan Actions / Dispatch Queue buttons (JWT-gated super_admin) + outbox viewer (`web/src/lib/api/admin.ts` → `runOrchestrator`, `getOutbox`).
- **`NotificationBell`** (`web/src/components/NotificationBell.tsx`): unread badge + dropdown over `public.notifications`; tap marks read + navigates `data.cta`. Mobile header + desktop sidebar (`openUp` prop — dropdown must open upward at bottom edge).
- Vault `gemini_api_key` updated to the 2.5-flash key (rishi-ask/kundali-ask share it).
- Note: outbox SELECT uses `is_admin()` — non-super roles see empty queue.
- **Scheduled** (migration 019): `pg_cron` jobs `engagement-plan` (03:30 UTC / 09:00 IST) and `engagement-send` (03:38 UTC) call the fn via `pg_net` with the vault hook secret. `select * from cron.job_run_details` for run history.

- Avatars now show **only** uploaded `profiles.avatar_path`; Google `user_metadata.avatar_url` no longer renders as the user's pfp (it made the profile look complete at first login while ProfileNudge correctly counted only the seeded name).

## Remaining blockers (external)

1. **Razorpay** sandbox key/secret + webhook secret → payment order/webhook Edge Functions + sandbox validation.
2. **Resend SMTP — user must apply settings** (Supabase Auth config can't be changed via MCP; needs dashboard or Management PAT). In Dashboard → Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings, enable custom SMTP: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465` (or `587`), username `resend`, password = the Resend API key, sender email = an address on a **verified Resend domain** (a send-only key cannot verify domains; without one, `onboarding@resend.dev` only delivers to the account owner's inbox). The key is stored in vault as `resend_api_key` for future notification functions — never committed.
3. **Razorpay** — client-side dependency: client hasn't provided credentials; payment order/webhook Edge Functions stay unimplemented until they do.
4. **Cloudflare account access** for the account owning `utsavam-backend` (wrangler login or API token) → add JWT verification to the Worker AI fallback, or retire it.
5. **Dashboard (user):** Auth Site URL; add `pratha://auth/callback` (or `pratha://**`) to redirect URLs for the Android OAuth flow; enable leaked-password protection (Authentication → Password protection).
6. `npm audit`: 10 moderate findings, not yet triaged.

## Delivery state

- PR #1 merged into `main` (squash `20b4934`); subsequent fixes are pushed to `main`.
- GitHub releases carry the debug APKs (`v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`). Debug-signed only — Play Store needs a release-signed AAB with the user's keystore.
- No secret values belong in this file or commits.

## Device QA fixes (on-device Redmi Note 13 5G, migration 023)
- **profiles UPDATE grant bug**: migration 005 granted column-level update on a *subset* of
  columns — `birth_date`, `birth_time`, `birth_place` were missing. Every `updateProfile`
  call wrote birth fields → **42501 → ALL profile saves failed** (phone, birth, everything).
  Migration 023 grants the three columns. Symptom reports: "phone won't save", "birth modal
  keeps appearing" — both same root cause.
- **updateProfile field-wipe bug**: it always wrote every column with `|| null` fallbacks, so
  a birth-details save *wiped* `phone` (and vice versa). Now only writes caller-supplied
  fields (`!== undefined` guard).
- **NotificationBell off-screen on mobile**: the mobile header uses `backdrop-blur-xl`,
  which makes it a containing block for `position:fixed` descendants — the notification
  panel rendered relative to the header, not the viewport, i.e. partially off-screen.
  Fixed by portaling the panel to `document.body` (createPortal) + `fixed inset-x-4
  bottom-4` mobile sheet (sm+: anchored dropdown).
- **Profile tab rail**: horizontal scroll rail now has `-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch`,
  `overscroll-behavior-x:contain`, `touch-action:pan-x` for reliable WebView swiping.
- **janma_ready notification** now fires from both birth-detail save paths
  (BirthDetailsPrompt + Profile Settings) via sendEngagementEmail → in-app + push + email.
- **WebView debugging recipe**: `adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>`
  then CDP `Runtime.evaluate` — works on debug builds; lets you drive/inspect the app's DOM
  directly. mobile-mcp can't see inside WebViews (accessibility exposes only the WebView
  container), so CDP is the better tool for in-app UI verification.


## Public landing page (added 2026-10-07)

- `/` now routes by auth state (`HomeOrLanding` in `web/src/App.tsx`): signed-out visitors get
  `web/src/features/landing/Landing.tsx`, signed-in devotees keep the `Home` dashboard.
- Landing is a full-bleed editorial page (escapes shell padding via negative margins) with:
  cinematic hero, discovery tile rail, festivals+events rail, maroon Sankalpa conversion band
  (top-3 published pujas with real prices), janma personalization split, dark Live Darshan band,
  Gaushala editorial, Seva participation grid, real-data trust strip, final CTA.
- New tokens: `--color-maroon`, `--color-maroon-deep`, `--color-saffron`, `--color-cream`
  (light + dark variants in `index.css`/`@theme`).
- New API fns in `discover.ts`: `getFestivals()`, `getEvents()` (list queries; detail fns unchanged).
- **Reveal pattern**: CSS scroll-driven `animation-timeline: view()` via `.landing-reveal` —
  content renders visible by default; no JS/IntersectionObserver dependency (learned: framer
  `whileInView` can strand content at opacity:0 in throttled/headless contexts).
- Verified: desktop 1440px + mobile 390px screenshots, all sections render, zero console errors.
- **Imagery audit (2026-10-07)**: cropped YouTube UI chrome off `kashi-vishwanath-aarti.jpg`
  (hero); replaced culturally-wrong/weak tile images — `sanctuary.jpg` was a Japanese-style
  pavilion (now unused on landing), `impact-bg` mandala dropped from Live Darshan tile.
  Current map: Temples→temple-hero, Pujas→kashi-aarti, Live Darshan→rudra-abhishekam,
  Gaushala→fodder-monsoon (tile) + auth-bg feeding photo (section), Seva→healing,
  Festivals→maha-sudarshana.
- **Sacred ambience**: `web/src/features/landing/ambience.ts` synthesizes a tanpura drone
  (Sa 136.1 Hz + Pa + octave shimmer, WebAudio, no copyrighted audio). Off by default;
  user taps the floating control. Swap in a licensed recording later by replacing the engine.
- **LandingFloaters**: floating Rishi orb (bottom-right, opens RishiChatModal) + ambience
  toggle; sits above the mobile bottom nav.
- **Gayatri ambience (2026-10-07)**: user-provided `gayatri.mp3` (39 min, 75MB) trimmed to a
  5-min faded 96kbps loop (~3.6MB) and uploaded to the new public `devotional-audio` Storage
  bucket (`gayatri-mantra.mp3`, migration `devotional_audio_bucket`: public read, admin-only
  write, audio mimes, 8MB cap). `ambience.ts` streams it with RAF volume fades; vercel.json CSP
  gained `media-src https://*.supabase.co`. Local copy removed from `public/`.
- **Ambience UX redesign (2026-10-07)**: replaced the generic speaker toggle with an
  intentional-activation flow — `AmbienceInvitation` pill in the hero ("Enter with the
  Gayatri Mantra") appears once on first visit only (pref === null); tap starts the chant,
  × dismisses permanently. Persistent control is a maroon medallion with breathing
  equalizer bars (not a speaker icon). `ambience.ts` persists `pratha:ambience` = on|off,
  targets 0.32 volume, 2.8s fade-in, suspends/resumes on tab visibility, all activation
  paths are user gestures (mobile-autoplay-safe). RishiChatModal header shows a
  "Begin with the Gayatri Mantra" chip when ambience is off.
- **Seva page rebuild (2026-10-07)**: `/seva` rewritten to landing art direction — dark
  fodder-monsoon hero (explicit cream title fixes light-theme invisible-h1 bug where the
  global `h1 {color: text-primary}` overrode inherited white), real `seva_campaigns` cards
  with goal progress + per-campaign DonationModal preselect, "journey of an offering" steps,
  honest trust strip. Removed ALL fabricated stats (450 cows / 1200kg / 45 treated) — only
  `welfare_stats` real numbers now.
- **Execution ledger (2026-10-07)**: `docs/PRATHA_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` is the canonical
  task queue (vision-PDF aligned). Executed this session: PRATHA-010 (auth context
  preservation — `redirectToLogin` + `?book/?campaign/?sponsor` deep-links reopen modals
  post-sign-in), PRATHA-200 (all routes lazy; Admin own chunk), PRATHA-041 (honest
  pending_payment copy verified), PRATHA-043 (puja deep-link), PRATHA-190 (RLS advisors
  clean), PRATHA-220/221 (prod sweep, zero console errors).
- **QA tooling**: `chromium --headless --screenshot --virtual-time-budget` races real
  network → false blanks. Use playwright-core (`/opt/devin-desktop/resources/app/
  node_modules/playwright-core`) + `--no-sandbox` system chromium + networkidle.
- **Dashboard tasks pending user**: PRATHA-011 Supabase redirect allowlist +
  PRATHA-193 leaked-password toggle; PRATHA-160 Resend domain; PRATHA-042 Razorpay keys.
- **Ledger pass 2 (2026-10-07)**: added `mantras` + `articles` tables (026/027 seeds),
  `saved_items` (025), `profiles.notifications_enabled` (024). New routes /mantras,
  /learn, /learn/:slug; nav extended. `web/src/lib/api/learn.ts` + `panchang.ts`
  (real Schlyter astronomy — the Home card was hardcoded before). Rishi replies can
  carry `LINK:/route|Label` chips; signed-out asks get a real sign-in prompt.
  Admin gained Activity tab (audit_log). Native platforms now land on Home, not
  the marketing page. Remaining launch gates live in PRATHA-240.
- **Release v1.1.8 (2026-10-07)**: debug APK `pratha-v1.1.8.apk` on GitHub Releases —
  versionCode 8 / versionName 1.1.8. Includes Learn/Mantras routes, sadhana streaks,
  saved temples, search, real panchang, Rishi links, notif opt-out; native shell
  routes `/` → Home. No emulator pass this cycle.

## Device QA sweep v1.1.8 (on-device Redmi Note 13 5G, 2026-10-09)

Full matrix + issue ledger: `web/android-testing-v118.md`. Swept launch, discovery,
auth, profile/settings, transactions, admin, notifications, offline/rotation,
aesthetics, and marketing funnel via mobile-mcp + WebView CDP + Supabase MCP.

Fixed during the sweep (all reverified on the rebuilt APK):

- `discover.ts` `mapEvent` — `.map()` on `activities_i18n` threw when events store it
  as a localized object `{"en":[...]}` → every non-demo event page 404'd. Now
  normalizes both shapes and keeps plain-string items.
- `DonationModal.tsx` — never imported `DonationModal.css` → modal rendered inline
  at page bottom, unreachable. Also: state (receiptId/amount) persisted across
  open/close (stale success screen) → reset on `isOpen`; success copy now echoes
  the captured `confirmedAmount`, not live state.
- `Home.tsx` — greeting was hardcoded "Good Morning/सुप्रभातम्" (showed at 18:30).
  Now hour-aware (Morning/Afternoon/Evening + matching Sanskrit).
- `NotificationBell.tsx` — read `data.cta` but broadcasts use `data.route` →
  in-app deep-links dead. Mapper now accepts both keys.
- `push.ts` — token upsert failed whenever the device token was bound to a previous
  account (conflict→UPDATE hits own-row RLS). Now calls SECURITY DEFINER RPC
  `register_push_token` (migration 031) which claims the token for the current user.
  Push-tap deep-link changed from `location.href` (WebView reload hazard) to
  `history.pushState` + `popstate`.
- `notify-send` broadcast — ignored `notifications_enabled`; pushed + inbox-inserted
  for ALL profiles. Now filters opted-out users from both paths.
- Migration 029 — `notifications_enabled` was missing from the profiles column-level
  UPDATE grant → Settings toggle PATCH 403'd silently. Granted.
- Migration 030 — `saved_items` remote table drifted (PK `entity_id uuid`, `create
  table if not exists` no-op in 025) → every save POST 400'd. Re-shaped to
  `entity_slug`/`entity_title` contract (table was empty).

Open issues carried forward (see matrix for severity/repro): 9-item bottom nav (N3),
raw-UUID passport ref (N4), Seva loading-flash + hero contrast (N6/N7), offline error
has no retry button (N13), Home fabricated stat fallbacks (N14), "Devotee Seeker"
placeholder (N15), janma doesn't derive nakshatra (N16), editor sees Plan/Dispatch
buttons that fail (N18). Not exercised live: F3 publish→broadcast + G3 heads-up
(would push to real users), C7 Google sheet, D11 avatar upload, H4 throttling.
- **Release v1.1.9 (2026-10-10)**: debug APK `pratha-v1.1.9.apk` on GitHub Releases —
  versionCode 9 / versionName 1.1.9. Includes on-device QA fixes from commit 07aa9aa:
  event page 404 fix, DonationModal fixes, Home greeting, NotificationBell deep-links,
  push token RLS, notify-send opt-out, migrations 029/030/031.
- **Terminology Update (2026-10-10)**: Replaced user-facing "Punya" / "Punya Points"
  terminology with "Seva Credits" across Profile (Invite & Earn, Journey tabs), Home,
  PujaDiscovery, Admin, and notify-send edge function templates.
