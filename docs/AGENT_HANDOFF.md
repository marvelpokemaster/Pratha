# Agent Handoff — Pratha

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last updated | 2026-09-26 |
| Branch | `devin/1790111517-pratha-supabase-platform` (PR #1, open) |
| Current phase | Hosted Supabase integration complete for catalog/Auth/booking/contribution; `rishi-ask` Edge Function live; external-credential work remains |
| Overall status | **Not production-ready.** Web, Android and Expo builds pass; hosted RLS/RPC flows verified end-to-end; AI works via deployed Edge Function with Cloudflare Worker fallback. Payments, notification provider, custom SMTP and Auth dashboard settings are blocked on credentials/approvals |

## Product and architecture

Pratha (formerly Sattva) is a cultural, temple, Pooja, Gaushala, Seva, and spiritual-assistance platform. The web app is React 19 + Vite + React Router + TanStack Query + Tailwind + Radix + Lucide. Android wraps `web/dist` with Capacitor. iOS uses the existing Expo SDK 57 DOM bridge in `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx`; do not rewrite the web UI into React Native primitives.

```text
React DOM web / Capacitor Android / Expo DOM iOS
                         ↓
Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL/RLS + RPCs (+ Edge Functions: not deployed)
                         ↓
Razorpay, Gemini, notifications (not configured)
```

The Cloudflare Worker and Firebase client remain only as fallback paths (Rishi AI still calls the Worker, request `{query}` → response `{response}`, with a local fallback answer). All catalog, profile, family, Auth, booking and contribution code uses `web/src/lib/supabase.ts` and `web/src/lib/api/*.ts`.

Expo bridge note: `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx` imports `QueryClientProvider`/`queryClient` re-exported from `web/src/App.tsx` so Metro uses one TanStack Query copy (two copies split the provider context). `expo/env.d.ts` types `import.meta.env` for the shared Supabase client.

## Hosted Supabase state

- Project `Pratha`, ref `yxwwgynxgihrktwndhep`, region `ap-south-1`, URL `https://yxwwgynxgihrktwndhep.supabase.co`
- Supabase MCP (`supabase-mcp-server`) has write access: `apply_migration`, `execute_sql`, `get_logs`, `get_advisors` were used. No local Supabase CLI.
- Browser key: publishable key fallback in `web/src/lib/supabase.ts`; deployments should set `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. `web/.env` does not exist locally.

Applied migrations (all hosted):

1. `001_sattva_schema` … 6. `006_demonstration_catalog`
7. `20260925000100_007_security_hardening.sql`
8. `20260926000100_008_restore_policy_helper_grants.sql` — 007 revoked EXECUTE on the six RLS helper functions from `anon`/`authenticated`, which broke every public SELECT (`42501 permission denied for function manages_temple`). Policy expressions run as the caller, so these helpers must stay executable. 008 restores that (matching 005).
9. `20260926000200_009_live_darshan_seed.sql` — `live_streams` demo rows using `website` provider to official portals (no stable official 24/7 stream exists; YouTube embeds supported by the UI).
10. `20260926000300_010_booking_status_enum_cast.sql` — `create_puja_booking` cast of CASE result to `booking_status`.
11. `20260926000400_011_booking_rpc_searchpath.sql` — restores `search_path = public, extensions` and generates refs from `gen_random_uuid()` (010 had dropped pgcrypto from the path → `gen_random_bytes does not exist`).
12. `20260926000500_012_indexes_and_extension_schema.sql` — 39 covering indexes on unindexed FKs + `pg_trgm` moved to `extensions` schema (advisor findings).
13. `20260926000600_013_edge_secret_accessor.sql` — `supabase_vault` extension + `public.get_edge_secret(text)` SECURITY DEFINER accessor granted to `service_role` only. The `gemini_api_key` vault secret was created via MCP (values never live in migration files).

Security model (verified via MCP): RLS enabled on all public tables; six policy helpers executable by anon/authenticated (intended); booking/contribution RPCs authenticated-only; payment/notification functions service-role-only; `profiles` has own-row SELECT/UPDATE only (rows created by `handle_new_user` trigger, so the client uses UPDATE, never UPSERT); bookings/contributions writable only through RPCs.

Advisor findings (2026-09-26, security): `anon/authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` for the six policy helpers — intentional, documented above; they only inspect `auth.uid()` roles. `complete_booking`, `generate_vaccine_alerts`, `recompute_trust_score` were audited and already contain internal role checks (`manages_temple`, `manages_gaushala`, `is_gaushala_admin`). `pg_trgm` moved out of `public` (012); all unindexed FKs covered (012). Remaining: leaked-password protection disabled (dashboard toggle, needs user).

Edge Function `rishi-ask` (deployed, `verify_jwt` + in-function `auth.getUser()` check; anon key alone rejected): Gemini key resolves from `GEMINI_API_KEY` function secret, else the `gemini_api_key` vault secret via `get_edge_secret`. `AI_MODEL` env overrides `gemini-2.5-flash`. Source: `supabase/functions/rishi-ask/index.ts`; client: `web/src/lib/api/ai.ts` falls back to the Worker on function failure.

The Cloudflare Worker `utsavam-backend` is deployed under a different Cloudflare account (`utsavam-api` workers.dev subdomain) than the one this environment's Cloudflare MCP can see — redeploying it to add JWT verification to `/api/v1/ai/ask` needs wrangler login for that account. Its unauthenticated AI route remains as fallback; treat as quota-exposure debt.

## Current implementation status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public Home | Working | Hosted Pooja + `welfare_stats` (`animals_cared`, `gaushalas`, `temples`); no fabricated meal stat |
| Discover + detail routes | Working | `/discover`, `/temples/:slug`, `/events/:slug`, `/festivals/:slug`, `/darshan`, `/darshan/:id` via `web/src/lib/api/discover.ts`. Event selects must use `categories!events_category_id_fkey(name)` (events has two FKs to categories → PostgREST 300 otherwise) |
| Pooja booking | Working | Date picker honors `lead_time_days`/`available_days`; sankalpa/nakshatra validation; real RPC errors shown; free → confirmed, paid → pending_payment; no fabricated references |
| Gaushala / passports | Working | Animals + `breeds(name)` + Gaushala embeds; chips filter client-side |
| Seva contributions | Working (unpaid) | Real published campaigns; `create_contribution` RPC; rows stay `created` until a payment flow exists |
| Profile/family | Working | Profile UPDATE and family insert verified via hosted E2E |
| Supabase Auth | Working, config pending | Email confirmation enforced; forgot-password + recovery screen in `Auth.tsx`; reset email hit default SMTP rate limit |
| Firebase/Worker retirement | Partial | Rishi primary = `rishi-ask` Edge Function (verified 200 with user JWT); Worker kept as unauthenticated fallback |
| Payments | Blocked | Needs Razorpay sandbox keys + webhook Edge Function + sandbox validation |
| AI Edge Function | Working | `rishi-ask` deployed and verified; Gemini key in vault; signed-in-only |
| Notification Edge Function | Blocked | Needs notification provider credentials |
| Expo | Passing | `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` succeeds |
| Android | Passing | `npx cap sync android` + `./gradlew assembleDebug` pass (set `ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk`) |

PostgREST reminder: to-one embeds return objects, not arrays (`row.temples?.name`, never `row.temples?.[0]`).

## Important files

- `web/src/App.tsx` — routes, QueryClient, AuthProvider; re-exports query provider for Expo.
- `web/src/features/auth/Auth.tsx` / `AuthContext.tsx` — Supabase Auth, forgot password, recovery.
- `web/src/features/discover/*` — Discover, TempleDetail, EventDetail, FestivalDetail, LiveDarshan.
- `web/src/features/pujas/PujaDetailModal.tsx` — booking UX (keep all hooks above the early return).
- `web/src/features/seva/DonationModal.tsx`, `web/src/features/gaushala/SponsorModal.tsx` — contributions.
- `web/src/lib/api/{puja,gaushala,profile,discover,errors,ai,client}.ts` — data layer; `errors.ts` maps RPC error codes to user messages.
- `web/scripts/e2e-hosted.mjs` — hosted Supabase E2E (auth, RLS, RPCs).
- `supabase/migrations/` — schema history through 011.
- `expo/src/PrathaDomBridge.tsx`, `expo/env.d.ts` — preserve.
- `web/android/` — generated Capacitor output; do not edit manually.

## Validation performed (2026-09-26)

- `web`: `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint` (0 errors, 9 warnings), `npm run build` pass.
- `expo`: `tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx expo export --platform web` succeeds.
- Android: debug APK `web/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` builds.
- Hosted E2E (`node web/scripts/e2e-hosted.mjs`): 19/19 passed — confirmed sign-in, anon reads, anon RPC rejection, profile update, cross-user insert rejection, family insert, booking validation errors, free/paid bookings, owner RLS reads, direct-insert rejection, contribution, cancellation.
- Browser QA (Python Playwright + system Chromium; the Playwright MCP needs `/opt/google/chrome/chrome`, which is not installed): 20 desktop (1440×900) + mobile (390×844) route checks with no console errors and no HTTP 300/4xx/5xx. Signed-in UI booking `PRT-192CBE75` and ₹10 contribution `4e025aae-…` verified in hosted rows via MCP (booking `confirmed` for 2026-09-27; contribution `created`, 1000 paise, campaign `50000000-…-0001`). Signed-out booking/donation redirect to `/login`.
- QA round 1 bugs fixed: booking modal Rules-of-Hooks crash, event 300 ambiguous embed, Gaushala `gaushala_id=eq.All` 400, wrong `welfare_stats` fields, array-shaped embeds.
- Migrations 012/013 applied via MCP: 39 FK indexes created (140 public indexes total), `pg_trgm` in `extensions`, `get_edge_secret` granted to service_role only (anon rejected with 42501).
- `rishi-ask` Edge Function v3 live: no auth header → 401, publishable-key-only → 401, signed-in user → 200 with a real Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` response.

## Remaining blockers (external)

1. **Razorpay** sandbox key/secret + webhook secret → payment order/webhook Edge Functions + sandbox validation.
2. **Resend SMTP — user must apply settings** (Supabase Auth config can't be changed via MCP; needs dashboard or Management PAT). In Dashboard → Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings, enable custom SMTP: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465` (or `587`), username `resend`, password = the Resend API key, sender email = an address on a **verified Resend domain** (a send-only key cannot verify domains; without one, `onboarding@resend.dev` only delivers to the account owner's inbox). The key is stored in vault as `resend_api_key` for future notification functions — never committed.
3. **Razorpay** — client-side dependency: client hasn't provided credentials; payment order/webhook Edge Functions stay unimplemented until they do.
4. **Cloudflare account access** for the account owning `utsavam-backend` (wrangler login or API token) → add JWT verification to the Worker AI fallback, or retire it.
5. **Dashboard (user):** Auth Site URL/redirect allow-list for production + Capacitor/Expo deep links; enable leaked-password protection (Authentication → Password protection).
6. `npm audit`: 10 moderate findings, not yet triaged.
